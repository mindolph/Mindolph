# v1.13 Release Note (Draft)

### New Features

* New, significant feature: AI Agent
	* Build intelligent agents easily based on your own knowledges to enable them to answer more specialized and specific questions.
	* This feature requires a PostgreSQL database (either local or remote, currently only PostgreSQL is supported) with the pgvector extension installed. The knowledge base's vector data will be stored in this database.
	* Configuration steps: Configure the LLM model -> Configure the database connection -> Create a dataset -> Perform embedding -> Create an agent
	* Usage: Select the Agent tab in the left sidebar -> Select the name of your agent -> Enter content in the chat box to start a conversation with the agent.

### Improvements

* Added a global option to hide file extensions in the workspace directory tree, the recently opened files list, and the opened file tabs.

* Improved the configuration of the currently used model in Gen-AI, now allowing you to select different models for both content generation and content summarization.

### Bug Fixes

N/A

### Dependencies

* Update langchain4j
