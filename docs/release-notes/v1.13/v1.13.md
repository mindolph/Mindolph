# v1.13 Release Note (Draft)

### New Features

* New, significant feature: AI Agent
	* Build intelligent agents easily based on your own knowledge to enable them to answer more specialized and specific questions.
	* This feature requires a PostgreSQL database (either local or remote, currently only PostgreSQL is supported) with the pgvector extension installed. The knowledge base's vector data will be stored in this database.
	* Configuration steps: Configure the LLM model APIs in the `Models` panel-> Configure the postgres database connection in the `Options` panel -> Go to the `Datasets` panel, create a dataset, and choose a language and embedding model for the dataset -> Select files you want to add to the created dataset -> Perform embedding -> Go to the `Agents` panel, create an agent, choose an embedding model and a chat model for the created agent, select your created datasets that you want to use for the created agent.
	* Usage: Select the Agent tab on the left side panel -> Select an agent from the agent list that you created  previously -> After the selected agent is loaded. Input content in the chat box to start a conversation with the agent.

### Improvements

* Added a global option to hide file extensions in the workspace directory tree, the recently opened files list, and the opened file tabs.

* Improved the configuration of the currently used model in Gen-AI, now allowing you to select different models for both content generation and content summary.

* The browser button in Mind Map note dialogs now opens URLs in an external browser by default.

### Bug Fixes

* Error messages from OpenAI are not displayed when generating content in a Mind Map. 

### Dependencies

* Updated JavaFX to 25, richtextfx to 0.11.6, mfx to 3.0.
* Updated bundled JDK to 25.
* Updated dependencies like langchain4j, plantuml, apache commons, etc.
